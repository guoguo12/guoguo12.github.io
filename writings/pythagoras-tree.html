<h2>Drawing a Pythagoras Tree using Racket</h2>

<div class="article-body">


<p>In this post, inspired by this week's <a target="_blank" href="http://daily-javascript.com/challenges/pythagoras-tree/">Daily JavaScript challenge</a>, I'll walk through how to use Racket's <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/turtles/index.html">turtle graphics library</a> to draw a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras_tree_(fractal)">Pythagoras tree</a>. I'll assume basic familiarity with <a href="http://racket-lang.org/" target="_blank">Racket</a>, but not with turtle graphics.</p>

<p>Our final result will look like this:</p>

<p><img src="img/pythagoras-tree-cropped.png"></p>
<h3 id="getting-started"><a name="user-content-getting-started" href="#getting-started" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Getting started</h3>

<p>Assuming we already have <a target="_blank" href="http://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a>, we'll need to install the <code>htdp-lib</code> package by typing the following into our terminal:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>raco pkg install htdp-lib
</code></pre>


<p>Now we can start. Let's create a new file called <code>pythagoras-tree.rkt</code>. It should start with</p>
<pre class="scheme"><code>#lang racket

(require graphics/turtles)
(turtles #t)
</code></pre>


<p>which imports the turtle graphics library and initializes the drawing window. If we run the program (<code>racket pythagoras-tree.rkt</code>), we see an empty window containing a small red triangle:</p>

<p><img src="img/turtle-home.png"></p>
<h3 id="turtles"><a name="user-content-turtles" href="#turtles" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Turtles</h3>

<p>The red triangle in the center is a <strong>turtle</strong>. It is capable of moving in a straight line and turning in place. It can also draw while moving.</p>

<p>We give the turtle instructions by using commands like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>(move 10)</code> means move 10 pixels forward without drawing.</li>
<li><code>(draw 10)</code> means move 10 pixels forward while drawing.</li>
<li><code>(turn 45)</code> means turn 45 degrees counter-clockwise.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find a full list of turtle commands <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/turtles/Traditional_Turtles.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Now consider the following procedure:</p>
<pre class="scheme"><code>(define (draw-stuff x) ; starting position: facing east
  (draw x)             ; draw east x pixels
  (turn 90)            ; turn north
  (draw x))            ; draw north x pixels
</code></pre>


<p>Calling <code>(draw-stuff 100)</code> would produce the following drawing:</p>

<p><img src="img/turtle-1.png"></p>

<p>Notice that the turtle is now pointing north.</p>

<p>We can extend this. Let's define <code>draw-stuff-2</code>:</p>
<pre class="scheme"><code>(define (draw-stuff-2 x) ; starting position: facing east
  (draw x)               ; draw east x pixels
  (turn 90)              ; turn north
  (draw x)               ; draw north x pixels
  (turn 90)              ; turn west
  (draw x)               ; draw west x pixels
  (turn 90)              ; turn south
  (draw (- x 5))         ; draw south x-5 pixels
  (turn 90)              ; turn east 
  (draw 5))              ; draw east 5 pixels
</code></pre>


<p>Now when we make the calls</p>
<pre class="scheme"><code>(draw-stuff-2 100)
(draw-stuff-2 90)
(draw-stuff-2 80)
(draw-stuff-2 70)
</code></pre>


<p>we get the following:</p>

<p><img src="img/turtle-2.png"></p>

<p>But making four separate calls to <code>draw-stuff-2</code> is annoying! Let's make our drawing function recursive:</p>
<pre class="scheme"><code>(define (draw-stuff-3 x) ; starting position: facing east
  (if (= x 0)            ; base case: we can't draw a spiral with 0 width!
      'done
      (begin
        (draw x)         ; same as in draw-stuff-2
        (turn 90)
        (draw x)
        (turn 90)
        (draw x)
        (turn 90)
        (draw (- x 5))
        (turn 90)
        (draw 5)
        (draw-stuff-3 (- x 10))))) ; recurse!
</code></pre>


<p>Now calling <code>(draw-stuff-3 350)</code> gives us a neat spiral:</p>

<p><img src="img/turtle-3.png"></p>

<p>(Mental exercise: Our spiral is off-center. Assuming our drawing window is 800 pixels wide, how would we make it centered in the drawing window?)</p>

<p>Now back to our original goal: drawing a Pythagoras tree.</p>

<p>We start by drawing a square that is <code>side</code> pixels wide and <code>side</code> pixels high. We can do this by first moving to the center of the northern edge of the square, then drawing along the perimeter counter-clockwise until we're done:</p>
<pre class="scheme"><code>(define (pythagoras-tree side) ; starting position: center of square, facing east
  (let ((half-side (/ side 2)))
    (turn 90)          ; now facing north
    (move half-side)   ; move north
    (turn 90)          ; now facing west
    (draw half-side)   ; draw west
    (turn 90)          ; now facing south
    (draw side)        ; draw south
    (turn 90)          ; now facing east
    (draw side)        ; draw east
    (turn 90)          ; now facing north
    (draw side)        ; draw north
    (turn 90)          ; now facing west
    (draw half-side))) ; draw west
</code></pre>


<p>Calling <code>(pythagoras-tree 100)</code> produces the following:</p>

<p><img src="img/pythagoras-tree-1.png"></p>

<p>Now what? We're going to recurse, but we'll be drawing <em>two</em> squares in the next step. In fact, with every step we'll double the number of squares to draw!</p>

<p>To proceed, we'll use the <code>split</code> procedure, which creates a new turtle where our current turtle is located. Any command we issue will then be executed by <em>both</em> turtles. Check out the documentation for the <code>split</code> procedure <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/turtles/Traditional_Turtles.html#%28form._%28%28lib._graphics%2Fturtles..rkt%29._split%29%29">here</a>.</p>

<p>Currently, at the end of our <code>pythagoras-tree</code> procedure, we're at the top of the current square (which we've just drawn) and we're facing west. We should now turn to face northwest, then <code>split</code> off another turtle facing northeast:</p>
<pre class="scheme"><code>(turn -45)         ; turn turtle 1 (current turtle) to face northwest
(split (turn -90)) ; create and turn turtle 2 to face northeast
</code></pre>

<p>Great! Now we have two turtles: The one facing northwest will draw the smaller square in the northwest corner. The one facing northeast will draw the smaller square in the northeast corner. Each will then <code>split</code> again, so that there are four turtles in total (and then eight, and then 16, and so on).</p>

<p>Before we can recursively call <code>pythagoras-tree</code>, we must move our turtles to the appropriate starting positions. Each turtle should be at the center of its new square, facing east relative to the square.</p>
<pre class="scheme"><code>(move (* half-side (sqrt 2))) ; move both turtles to the centers of the new squares
(turn -90)                    ; adjust them to face east
(pythagoras-tree (* (/ (sqrt 2) 2) side)) ; recurse!
</code></pre>


<p>The mathematical calculations involved are captured in this crude diagram:</p>

<p><img src="img/pythagoras-tree-2.png"></p>
<h3 id="our-final-code"><a name="user-content-our-final-code" href="#our-final-code" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Our final code</h3>

<p>Now we simply add a base case, and we're done! Here's our completed <code>pythagoras-tree</code> procedure:</p>
<pre class="scheme"><code>(define (pythagoras-tree side) ; starting position: center of square, facing east
  (if (&lt; side 3) ; this seems like a good stopping point...
      (home)     ; clear all turtles except the original
      (let ((half-side (/ side 2)))
        (turn 90)        ; now facing north
        (move half-side) ; move north
        (turn 90)        ; now facing west
        (draw half-side) ; draw west
        (turn 90)        ; now facing south
        (draw side)      ; draw south
        (turn 90)        ; now facing east
        (draw side)      ; draw east
        (turn 90)        ; now facing north
        (draw side)      ; draw north
        (turn 90)        ; now facing west
        (draw half-side) ; draw west

        (turn -45)         ; turn turtle 1 (current turtle) to face northwest
        (split (turn -90)) ; create and turn turtle 2 to face northeast

        (move (* half-side (sqrt 2))) ; move both turtles to the centers of the new squares
        (turn -90)                    ; and adjust them to face east
        (pythagoras-tree (* (/ (sqrt 2) 2) side))))) ; recurse!
</code></pre>


<p>And now we call <code>(pythagoras-tree 100)</code> and we get:</p>
