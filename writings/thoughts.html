        <h4>Thoughts on CS 61AS</h4>
        <div class="dateline">Thursday, 11 December 2014</div>
        <p>
        CS 61AS is the self-paced version of CS 61A, the standard intro-to-CS course at Berkeley.
        61AS differs from 61A in that lessons are taught through an online learning platform and there are weekly quizzes instead of midterms.
        61AS also uses a different programming language&mdash;Scheme, instead of Python&mdash;and follows the classic <i><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/" target="_blank">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a></i>.
        </p>
        <p>
        After taking CS 61AS this past semester, I feel obliged to share my thoughts about this rather unique course, which was taken by only a hundred or so students this semester.
        (By comparison, 61A was taken by over 1,200 students.)
        Rather than focusing on the course structure, I want to discuss the content of the course and the effectiveness of Scheme as a teaching language.
        </p>
        <h6>Okay, cut to the chase. How hard was it?</h6>
        <p>
        For me, 61AS wasn't too bad. But I'm almost certain that students with little or no programming experience would find this course significantly harder than 61A.
        Why? Because <i>SICP</i> is <i>hard</i>.
        It's no <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> and it's no <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/" target="_blank" title="Learn Python the Hard Way">LPTHW</a>.
        A few years back, Professor Brian Harvey wrote a <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/sicp.html" target="_blank">short essay</a> detailing the merits of SICP, and I think he nailed it on the head:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
        SICP was firmly optimistic about what a college freshman can be expected to accomplish. SICP students write interpreters for programming languages, ordinarily considered more appropriate for juniors or seniors. The text itself isn't easy reading; it has none of the sidebars and colored boxes and interesting pictures that typify the modern textbook aimed at students with low attention spans. There are no redundant exercises; each exercise teaches an important new idea. It uses big words. But it repays a close reading; every sentence matters.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
        Luckily, the homework assignments&mdash;usually exercises from <i>SICP</i>&mdash;are graded with some leniency. You don't have to get everything correct, but you are expected to demonstrate effort.
        There are four projects throughout the semester, each of which takes perhaps 4&ndash;10 hours to complete.
        They look daunting at first&mdash;my final project involved building a Python interpreter&mdash;but a lot of the complicated framework code is given to you, meaning your job mostly involves reading the existing code and adding features. So basically, in terms of coursework, you should expect to be challenged, but you shouldn't expect to find yourself curled up in the corner in the fetal position.
